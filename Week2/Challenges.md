# Week-2 Challenges Faced:
#### Resolved Issues:
1. Same content sent again was ignored by Kafka, so `enable_auto_commit` was used to ensure messages were consumed properly.
2. Kafka wouldn't work due to port `9092` being blocked by the firewall. Resolved by allowing the port through the firewall settings.
#### Open Issues:
##### (None)
